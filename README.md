Lumped Element Problem: A lossless 50 Ohm coaxial transmission line is to be matched to a satellite parabolic antenna with
ZL= (75-j20) Ohms. I used an LC matching network with a center frequency of 6GHz.

A 100 MHz FM broadcast station uses a 300 Ohm transmission line between the transmitter and a tower-
mounted half-wave dipole antenna with impedance equal to 73 Ohms. I performed this matching using a quater wavelength transformer. I determined the characteristic impedance of the 1/4 wave section, the physical length if it is made with polyesterene with an relative permittivity of 2.56, and the bandwitdth for a reflection coefficient less than 5%.
