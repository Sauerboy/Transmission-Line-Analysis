Lumped Element Problem: A lossless 50 Ohm coaxial transmission line is to be matched to a satellite parabolic antenna with
ZL= (75-j20) Ohms. I used an LC matching network with a center frequency of 6GHz. Lumped element matching is very useful on IC's because very small inductors and capacitors can be realized.
